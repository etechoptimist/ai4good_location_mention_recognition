## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to the Location Mention Recognition challenge. The task is to develop a model capable of identifying and extracting mentions of geographical locations from unstructured text, using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Approaches

- First Approaches is usign Spacy Model: SpaCy emerged as my top choice after evaluating several options, and here’s why:
SpaCy’s efficiency and speed make it ideal for real-time applications, particularly during disaster response scenarios where low latency is critical. Its CNN-based models, such as en_core_web_lg, are optimized for production and offer faster processing compared to heavier transformer models like BERT. This ensures swift extraction of location data from a high volume of tweets.

Additionally, SpaCy’s ease of use and developer-friendly design allow for quick integration into production workflows. With prebuilt pipelines for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), tokenization, and dependency parsing, it enables rapid development without needing to delve into the complexities of deep learning models. The platform also offers a flexible architecture, allowing for customization of pipelines and model components to fit domain-specific needs, such as disaster-related NER.

Memory efficiency is another standout feature. SpaCy’s models, particularly the non-transformer ones, are lightweight, making them well-suited for environments with limited computational resources. For scenarios that require state-of-the-art accuracy, SpaCy also supports transformers, offering a balanced approach between speed and accuracy.
