This repository contains my solution to the Location Mention Recognition challenge. The task is to develop a model capable of identifying and extracting mentions of geographical locations from unstructured text, using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Detailed pipeline for cleaning and preparing the dataset, including handling noisy data, tokenization, and entity labeling.
Modeling: I leverage transformer-based architectures (such as BERT) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, specifically tailored to recognize locations.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, ensuring a balanced approach to correctly identifying locations while minimizing false positives.
